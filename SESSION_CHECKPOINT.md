# Brikblok Session Checkpoints

## Session 1 - Platform Discovery & Documentation Update
Explored brikblok repository structure and discovered it has evolved far beyond the original "minimal BrickLink API examples" described in the README. Found a comprehensive LEGO set management system with 200+ sets database, CLI tools, web interfaces, bulk operations, XML import/export, minifigure tracking, and BrickLink OAuth 1.0a integration. Reviewed SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md revealing the project's organic growth from simple CLI app to full-stack collection management platform. Understood brikblok's role as an "artifact codex" within the Redder Edge ecosystem - a resonance carrier embodying vulnerability as strength, quiet leadership, and imperfect growth through SSP (sync and ship, please) workflow. Updated README.md to accurately reflect current comprehensive capabilities as LEGO set management platform rather than basic API examples, and refreshed SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md to document the platform's evolution and philosophical alignment with Redder Edge principles of fractal storytelling across scales from individual pieces to cultural preservation.
