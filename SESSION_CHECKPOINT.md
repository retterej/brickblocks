# BrickBlocks Project Checkpoint

## Session Summary

Built a complete LEGO sets management system using BrickLink API integration. Started with minimal CLI app that takes set numbers and auto-fetches details (name, year, dimensions, weight) from BrickLink's OAuth 1.0a API. Created web frontend using lowdiatribe architecture pattern with Express.js, EJS templating, and responsive CSS. Added simple tracker for storing set numbers before API integration. Configured BrickLink credentials (Consumer Key/Secret + OAuth tokens) and successfully tested API endpoints. Discovered BrickLink provides complete piece lists and counts via `/items/SET/{set-number}/subsets` endpoint - Colosseum has 9,036 pieces. Established "ssp" shortcut for sync-ship-push workflow (git add/commit/push, will include deploy in prod). Project includes CLI tools, simple web tracker, and full web app with BrickLink integration ready for piece count features.

## Key Files
